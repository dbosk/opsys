Before attempting this assignment you should have read all chapters up to and 
including Chapter 9 ``Virtual-Memory Management'' in 
\cite{Silberschatz2013intl,Silberschatz2013osc}.

The following tools from the UNIX-like command-line can be of use:
\begin{itemize}
	\item cat(1),
	\item wc(1), specifically options \emph{-w} and \emph{-l}; and
	\item grep(1).
\end{itemize}
Read the manual pages to get an overview of what these commands do.
