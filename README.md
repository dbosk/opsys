This is the course material I developed while giving a course on Operating 
Systems Theory.  The main part of the material was developed during the autumn 
of 2013 while at Mid Sweden University.

To compile the TeX files into PDFs: don't forget to `git submodule update 
--init`, since you need the submodules to build.


File structure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory structure is as follows:

    studyguide      Contains the Study Guide contains a short description of
                    the course, intended learning outcomes, reading
                    instructions.

    lectures        Contains the lecture slides and reading instructions for
                    each lecture in the course.

    theory          Contains theory assignments, i.e. assignments focusing
                    on using the theory of the course.

    labs            Contains laboratory assignments, these assignments are
                    intended to help understanding the theory.


Currently, the directory `lectures` doesn't build.  This is because all figures 
are missing.  These figures must be mapped from the zip-file provided by the 
OSC book.
